This is the list of projects I developed in my free time:

- ## Nestjs email authentication
This project is an example of implementation of a user **email authentication** with [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) v5.0, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [PassportJs](http://www.passportjs.org)

It can be used as base of a nestjs project: it implements API for login/registration of a user in a database and features of **email verification**, **forgotten password**, **reset password**, **update profile** and **settings**.

- ## Four in a row - AI
This project is an implementation in javascript of the algorithm [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) with [Alpha-Beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) applied to the game `Connect Four`.

It uses [EaselJs](https://www.createjs.com/easeljs) for drawing the board, as support for working with the HTML5 Canvas element.

You can find the project [here](https://github.com/marcomelilli/four-in-a-row-js-minimax) and a [live demo](http://connectfour.marcomelilli.com)!
