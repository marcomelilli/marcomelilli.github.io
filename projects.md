This is the list of projects I developed in my free time:


##  Big Bench App
I'm the co-creator of [Big Bench App](https://big-bench.com) a mobile app for **IOS** and **Android** that helps users to locate the big benches in the world. I worked on the mobile app and on the backend, and it was a great experience.

Try the app from the stores or follow our project on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bigbenchapp) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bigbenchapp/)

##  Nestjs email authentication
This project is an example of implementation of a user **email authentication** with [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) v5.0, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [PassportJs](http://www.passportjs.org)

It can be used as base of a nestjs project: it implements API for login/registration of a user in a database and features of **email verification**, **forgotten password**, **reset password**, **update profile** and **settings**.

##  ATM Bot Notifier
I made a little **telegambot** that updates you every morning with the news of the ATM metro and during the day notifies you about status changes.

It could be useful to know in real time if the subway is suspended and quickly look for alternatives. Link to the [channel](https://t.me/metro_atm)

## HomeAssistant
I started to develop a **homeautomation system** for my home using a Raspberry and [Homeassistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## Four in a row - AI
This project is an implementation in javascript of the algorithm [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) with [Alpha-Beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) applied to the game **Connect Four**.

![game screenshot](https://github.com/marcomelilli/four-in-a-row-js-minimax/raw/master/img/game-screen.png)
It uses [EaselJs](https://www.createjs.com/easeljs) for drawing the board, as support for working with the HTML5 Canvas element.
You can find the project [here](https://github.com/marcomelilli/four-in-a-row-js-minimax) and a [live demo](http://connectfour.marcomelilli.com)!
