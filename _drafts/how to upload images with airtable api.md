\# **How to upload images with airtable api**

Airtable doesnâ€™t allow you to directly upload attachments via their api. In the request we need to send the URL of the resource hosted in another server. In this way airtable can download the file and upload a copy in its server.

The easiest way I found for my projects is using \[Cloudbinary\]([https://cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com "https://cloudinary.com")) because it offers a generous free plan (25 monthly credits where 1 credit == 1GB of managed storage).
